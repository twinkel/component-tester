Component tester for atmega processors. This tester tests and measures:
diodes, fets, capacitors, Resistors, transistors

ToDo:
  - make it bootloader tolerant
  - capacitors measures factor 14 too big
  - baudrate = 38400 (factor 16), does not use F_CPU
  - further issues with 16MHz crystal?
  - pin swap sometimes erratic (HW problem?)
  - check battery measurement = 20.46V, no divider
  - swap pins to use hardware serial port

project changes:
4 jan 2012:
  - modified to run on ATmega168/328 @ 16MHz
  - disable watchdog, to comply with arduino loader
  - disable SWuart invert
  - added battery voltage display before each measurement
